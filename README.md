# PCA-MLprojects
This is a matlab project for generating Principal Components of greyscale facial images. It compresses grayscale images of human faces by applying Principal Component Analysis and selecting only the first 200 components. Then, the images are reconstructed from these components to gauge information loss. This project helped in improving my understanding of how PCA works and how it could be used. 

### Screenshot
The following is a sample of images that were used and the output generated by the program -
